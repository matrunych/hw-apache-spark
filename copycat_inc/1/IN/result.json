            "description": "Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man\u2019s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking \u201cdid this really happen?\u201d This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.  Directed by: Rajkumar Hirani.  Produced by: Vinod Chopra Films and Rajkumar Hirani Films in association with Fox Star Studios.Also Subscribe To FoxStarIndia: http://goo.gl/Y8HGhYFoxStarSouth : http://goo.gl/AO8IsZSocial Media LinksFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/foxstarhindiTwitter: https://twitter.com/foxstarhindiInstagram: http://instagram.com/foxstarhindiPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/foxstarhindi/Dailymotion:http://www.dailymotion.com/FoxStarHindi",
